    1. Preheat oven to 450°F. Place oven racks in the upper and middle positions.
    2. Wash and dry the fresh produce. (Skip the arugula if it came pre-washed.)
    3. Peel, halve, and slice onion lengthwise into ¼-inch thick pieces; halve tomatoes. Transfer both to a baking sheet pan, drizzle with oil, and season with spices. Toss to combine, then spread out in an even layer.
    4. Place baking sheet on the upper rack of the oven (it doesn't have to be fully heated) and roast, tossing halfway through, until veggies soften, about 15 minutes.
    5. Meanwhile, arrange flatbreads on a large baking sheet. Place on the lower rack and bake, flipping halfway through, until slightly crispy, about 8 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.
    6. While the flatbreads are baking, juice lemon into a medium bowl.
    7. Peel and mince garlic; mince capers. Add both to the bowl with the lemon juice along with oil, Dijon, salt, and pepper; whisk to combine the dressing.
    8. Trim, seed, and small dice bell pepper; add to the bowl with the dressing and set aside.
    9. Coarsely grate mozzarella.
    10. Pick basil leaves off the stems, roll up crosswise, and thinly slice into ribbons.
    11. When the veggies are done, sprinkle mozzarella over the flatbreads; top with the roasted veggies and half of the basil. (Reserve remaining basil for serving.)
    12. Return flatbreads to the oven and bake until warmed through and cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven.
    13. Meanwhile, add arugula to the bowl with the dressing and bell pepper; toss to combine the salad.
    14. Slice flatbreads, divide between plates, and sprinkle with reserved basil. Serve with salad on the side and enjoy!
