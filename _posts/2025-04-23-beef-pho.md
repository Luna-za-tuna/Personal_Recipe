    1. Thinly slice ginger. Peel onion. And place pho spices in the spice bag it comes with. You can toast/ char these ingredients.
    2. Place all of your ingredients into an instant post: blanched beef bones, blanched beef shank/ brisket, onion, ginger slices, pho spice, rock sugar, salt, and water. 
    3. Pressure cook for 45 minutes. Note: While broth is cooking, prepare your scallion, cilantro, onion and whatever other toppings you want to use
    4. Once your broth is done cooking in the instant pot, quick release/ set instant pot to vent, remove and discard everything— spice bag, beef bones and ginger slices. For beef shank, leave it off to the side to completely cool before thinly slicing.
    5. Once you removed everything from the broth, pour your broth through a fine strainer
    6. This next step is optional— remove the fat from you pho broth. You can use a fat separator or you can also leave it to cool overnight and scoop out the fat that hardens at the top.
    7. When ready to serve, warm broth and season to preference. Recommend about 1 1/2 TBSP fish sauce and 2 TBSP chicken bouillon.
    8. Assemble bowl by giving pho noodles a quick dunk in boiling water for 15-30 seconds and then add your preferred toppings.
