  notes_markdown: |-
    * For a less acidic marg, you can use 2 shots of orange juice and 1 shot of lime, but you need to use only 1/2-1 shot of simple syrup since the orange is sweeter.
    * If you use something like Grand Marnier you will likely need to add more water or simple syrup to balance the added alcohol or drop it to 1/2 shot of Grand Marnier.
