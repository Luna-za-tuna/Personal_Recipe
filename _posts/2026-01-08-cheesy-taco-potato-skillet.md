  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Peel, wash potatoes, and cut up into cubes.
    2. Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika (I don’t use exact measurements for this part).
    3. Cook potatoes in the air fryer at 400 degrees for about 20-25 minutes shaking them around at least a couple times while they cook.
    4. Heat a skillet over medium high heat.
    5. Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned. Drain any extra grease. Season with salt, cayenne, chili powder, cumin, paprika, dried cilantro, and black pepper. Add minced garlic and stir well.
    6. Once the potatoes and ground beef are cooked combine them together in the skillet and top with shredded cheddar cheese. Put the skillet in the oven at 400 degrees F to melt the cheese.
    7. Pour warmed up Queso over them. Top with sour cream and cilantro. This is also good wrapped up in tortillas as burritos!
