  directions_markdown: |-
    1. In a large magnalite or dutch oven over medium-high heat, add olive oil and smoked sausage. Cook for about 5 minutes to render the fat and remove from the pot with a slotted spoon.
    2. Season your chicken with the salt and pepper then add to the pot. Cook for about 2 minutes per side or until they develop a golden crust. Remove and set aside with the sausage.
    3. In the same pot, add onions, bell peppers and celery. Add about 1 tablespoon of water to help deglaze the bottom of the pot. Sauté the vegetables for about 5 minutes or until tender.
    4. Add in garlic and tomato paste. Cook for an additional 30 seconds.
    5. Pour in the cream of chicken and mix until well combined.
    6. Add the meats back to the pot with the drippings along with the raw pasta.
    7. Pour in chicken broth, bay leaves, dried thyme and Southern Made Creole Seasoning. Mix everything until well combined and remember, “If you ain’t sneezing, it ain’t seasoned!”
    8. Bring to a boil then reduce to a low simmer on low heat. Cover and let cook for 15 minutes or until the pasta is tender.
    9. Remove the lid, stir in green onion and just like my name, you’re all done!
