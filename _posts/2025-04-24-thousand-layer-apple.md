  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Preheat oven to 400F
    2. Peel and core your apple.
    3. Then carefully slice into 1/16” slices with a knife or mandolin.
    4. Combine melted butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a medium mixing bowl. 
    5. Coat each slice with melted butter mixture and stack in a ramekin until you reach the top. Be sure to press down on the layers a few times throughout stacking and pour out the excess liquid back into your bowl.
    6. Once you’ve reached the top of your ramekin, bake for 10 minutes.
    7. Carefully pour out the excess liquid in your ramekin and top your stack with a piece of puff pastry brushed with egg wash. Return to the oven for 20 minutes.
    8. For best results, let it cool completely before serving. Loosen your stack from the ramekin with a butter knife, and serve upside down with ice cream.
