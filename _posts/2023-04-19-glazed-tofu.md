  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Prepare the tofu by draining it, and then pressing it for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 
    2. Once pressed, remove the tofu and pat dry. 
    3. Use a knife to score a diamond pattern across the surface of the tofu cutting about 1/4 inch deep. 
    4. Add the soy sauce and liquid smoke to a sealable bag or container, then add the tofu. Let the tofu marinate for a minimum of 1 hour or as long as overnight in the fridge, flipping the tofu every now and then to ensure both sides get marinated.
    5. When ready to roast the tofu, preheat your oven to 375F (190C). Line a small baking dish with parchment paper.
    6. Remove the tofu from the marinade and place on the prepared baking dish. Poke a whole clove into the center of each diamond. 
    7. Bake for 50 - 60 minutes until the tofu is a dark golden brown.
    8. While the tofu is baking make the glaze by adding the brown sugar, butter, water, mustard, garlic, and cinnamon to a small pot. 
    9. Put over medium-high heat, bring to a simmer while whisking often, and cook for about two minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
    10. Once the tofu has baked and is golden brown, remove from the oven, pour the prepared glaze on top, then return to the oven and bake for another 10 - 15 minutes until the glaze is bubbling. 
    11. Remove from the oven and let cool 10 minutes. Remove the cloves using a fork or kitchen tweezers before serving. 
  notes_markdown: |-
    * To cook in an airfryer, lower temp by 25 degrees and cook for around 25 minutes while keeping an eye on it. 
    * If you do not want to do the added decoration of the whole cloves, simply omit them and instead add â…› teaspoon ground clove to the glaze.
