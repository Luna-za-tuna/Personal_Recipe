  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Preheat oven to 400F
    2. Brown ground beef with a chopped onion in a skillet over medium high heat. 
    3. Once browned drain grease and season with salt, pepper, cumin, dried cilantro, chili powder, and cayenne. You could use a taco seasoning packet instead of these seasoning if you would rather do that.
    4. Add one can of drained corn, one can of Rotel (not drained), 1 cup sour cream, and about 1 cup of shredded Colby Jack cheese. 
    5. Stir everything together well. Top with one more cup of shredded cheese.
    6. Top with tater tots or the crispy crowns. Bake for about 35 minutes or until the tater tots are cooked to your liking. You can also broil the casserole for a few minutes to help the tots get crispy.
    7. Top with Buffalo Wild Wing’s Southwest Ranch. Enjoy! Let me know if you try it out!

    * If you want to cut down on the heat omit the cayenne and make sure to use a mild Rotel!
