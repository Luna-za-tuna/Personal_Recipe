    1. Take three bowls out and prepare the dredging station in this order: flour w/ salt and pepper in one bowl, whisked eggs w/ salt and pepper in the second bowl, and the breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper in the last bowl. 
    2. Take each chicken strip and dip it into the flour, shake off the excess, proceed to dip into the egg mixture, and then the breadcrumbs. 
    3. If the air-fryer you have has pre-heating instructions or a pre-heat button, please be sure to do that. Spray each chicken strip with oil spray on each side and place it in the air-fryer basket. 
    4. Air-fry at 415F for 9-10 minutes flipping them over once halfway through.
