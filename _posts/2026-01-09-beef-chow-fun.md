  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Marinate the thinly sliced beef with 1 teaspoon soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sweet soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch.
    2. Add 1 teaspoon of oil to lock in the flavor and keep the beef tender and juicy, then set aside while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
    3. Soak 200g of flat rice noodles in hot water for the time recommended on the package. Once softened, drain and rinse the noodles with cold water. 
    4. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil over the noodles and gently toss to keep them from sticking.
    5. Slice one onion (100g), Chop some scallions (50g) and separate white and green parts, Mince 4 cloves of garlic
    6. Beat 2 eggs
    7. If you do not have grated ginger, grade some ginger (1 tsp)
    8. In a small bowl, mix soy sauce (1 tbsp), sweet soy sauce (1 tbsp), oyster sauce (1 tbsp) and white pepper (1/2 tsp).  Stir it well and leave it aside.
    9.  Heat a pan or wok over high heat until smoking hot. Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil.  
    10. Once the oil is hot, add the beef slices. Spread them out in a single layer. Let them sear for 1 minute without stirring, then flip and stir-fry for another minute.  Remove the beef from the pan and set aside.
    11. Add 4 minced garlic cloves and 1 teaspoon grated ginger to the same pan or wok, and sauté for 30 seconds.
    12. Add the white parts of the scallions and cook for another 30 seconds. Stir in the onions and sauté for 30 seconds more. Remove everything from the pan and set aside.
    13. Add 2 beaten medium eggs to the same pan or wok and scramble for about 1 minute, or until fully cooked. Transfer the scrambled eggs to the same bowl with the garlic, ginger, scallions, and onions.
    14. In the same pan or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil, then add the noodles along with half of the stir-fry sauce. Stir-fry over high heat for 1 minute — this helps the noodles soak up the sauce, adding extra flavour.
    15. Return everything to the pan or wok — the scrambled eggs, sautéed garlic, ginger, scallions, onions, cooked beef, and the remaining stir-fry sauce. Then stir-fry over high heat for 1 minute.
    16. Add 100g bean sprouts and the green parts of the scallions, then stir for another 30 seconds.  
    17. Remove from the heat — and you’re done! Enjoy.
