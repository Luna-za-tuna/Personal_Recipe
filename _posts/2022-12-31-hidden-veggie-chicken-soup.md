  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Fill a big pot with water or ½ water and ½ organic unsalted vegetable broth. Add in the whole peeled and washed vegetables and let it come to a boil. Once boiling, add the chicken thighs. Skim off any foam with a spoon and add salt. Make sure to add more as  
    2. you taste and adjust at the very end.
    3. Once everything is boiling, be sure to reduce the heat to medium-low and semi cover it with a lid. Let it go for 45 minutes or until the veggies are all super soft, the chicken is boiled, and broth has reduced.
    4. You can now take out the chicken, let it cool, shred or cut it. If the chicken has bone or skin, you can compost it. Take out the whole veggies with a slotted spoon and throw them in the blender with two ladles of the clear broth.
    5. Blend until everything is nice and smooth, add it back into the pot with the shredded chicken. Add the boiled potatoes, parsley for garnish, stir and enjoy. You can also add raw potatoes or pastina so please look at my notes below.
