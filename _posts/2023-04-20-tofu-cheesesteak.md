  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Preheat oven to 350F
    2. Remove tofu from packaging and pat dry. Slice into thin strips.
    3. Make the marinade by combining everything in a bowl. 
    4. Add the tofu strips to the bowl and toss to coat them in the marinade. Don't worry if you break up the slices!
    5. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper / cooking spray and spread out the tofu pieces in a single layer. 
    6. Bake at 350 F for 20 - 30 minutes, or until the tofu is slightly dried out and chewy.
    7. While the tofu is baking, grill up the diced onion in some oil and vegan butter. 
    8. Once tofu is baked, add it to the pan with the grilled onion.
    9. Add 1 cup of liquid (either water, broth, or a mixture, depending on how salty you want the meat) and stir to combine. 
    10. Bring to a simmer and then simmer until the liquid is mostly reduced. About 10 - 15 minutes. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
    11. Add tofu to rolls/bun and add cheese sauce
