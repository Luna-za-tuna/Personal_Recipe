    1. Ensure chicken is dry by patting down with a paper towel to ensure crispy skin. You can half the wings as I did to some of them or use them whole.
    2. Add flour, baking powder (not soda!) and seasonings to the chicken wings until well coated.
    3. Arrange the wings in a single layer in the air fryer. Sprayed them with oil.
    4. Airfry at 300F for 15 mins, then flip the wings and turn the temp up to 400F for 15 mins or until golden and crisp (165C internal temp).
    5. Alternatively you can bake in the oven; for 30 mins at 300F in a preheated oven (at the lower shelf), then flip all the wings, turn the oven up to 400F and cook for another 35-40 mins or until golden and crisp, this time on the middle shelf.
    6. For the sticky sauce: add butter and sesame oil into a pan, add garlic and allow the garlic to saut√© for 2-3 mins.
    7. Add the honey, soy sauce, chilli flakes and sesame seeds, mix together and allow to simmer for another 3-4 mins on medium heat, stirring occasionally.
    8. Once slightly thickened to coat the back of a spoon, leave to cool
    9. Once cooled and the wings are fully cooked, add the hot wings into the sauce and coat well and serve fresh.
