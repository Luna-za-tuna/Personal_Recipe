    * 84 Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps for a half sheet size sheet pan 18x13

    1. Place a rack at the highest position in the oven. Preheat to 375 degrees.
    2. Line a 18x13 half size sheet pan with parchment paper. Line 84 pretzel crisps 7 across by 12 down overlapping the bottom of each row of crisps with the next row. Set aside.
    3. To a medium pot over medium heat melt butter and brown sugar together. Whisk until it blends. About 3-4 minutes.
    4. Once bubbles form in the middle of the pot set a timer for 3 minutes. Stir every 30 seconds.
    5. Pull off the heat and pour the caramel mixture over the pretzel crisps as evenly as possible.
    6. Put in the oven on the top rack for 5 minutes.
    7. Remove pan from the oven. 
    8. If you want chocolate melted on the pretzels, immediately add chocolate chips to the hot pretzels. 
    9. If you do not want chocolate, you'll immediately add flaky salt and then start separating the crisps with tongs and placing them on a cooling rack. Allow this version to harden for 2 hours before eating (if you can resist).
    10. Let the chocolate chips sit on the hot pretzels for 5 minutes. The heat will soften the chocolate. Spread chocolate chips with a knife and sprinkle flaky salt on top.
    11. Let the Christmas crack harden for 3 hours before breaking in pieces. If you're in a hurry you can freeze for 10 minutes and then break apart. It's best to let it harden at room temperature, however.
