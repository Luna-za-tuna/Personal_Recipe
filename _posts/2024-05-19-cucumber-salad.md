    1. Cut the tips of the cucumbers off then place them between two chop sticks and cut diagonal all the way down the cucumber
    2. Place in a bowl and add a couple pinches of salt (you cant put too much since we will rinse them later) 
    3. Mix and let sit for about 10-15 minutes while you prepare the rest
    4. Add the rest of the ingredients to a bowl and mix well
    5. Rinse off the cucumbers thoroughly and add the sauce to the cucumbers
    6. Mix well and you can eat immediately, but it is better if you let it sit overnight to really absorb the flavors
