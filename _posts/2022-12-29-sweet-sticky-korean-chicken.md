    1. Dice your skinless boneless chicken thighs into bite size pieces, about 6 equal bite size pieces per thigh.
    2. Add your chicken pieces to a large bowl followed by cornstarch. Mix well to coat each piece of chicken. Itâ€™s okay if the excess starch falls off as long as your chicken in coated in it.
    3. In a smaller bowl, whisk together your sauce ingredients as listed.
    4. In a smoking hot wok set over medium high heat, add oil. Once oil begins to smoke, carefully add the coated chicken. Spread it out evenly and do not move it. Fry on one side for 5-7 minutes or until golden crispy brown.
    5. Reduce heat to medium and flip chicken over to fry on the other side for another 5-7 minutes or until golden and crispy.
    6. Remove cooked chicken and transfer to a plate.
    7. Increase heat to medium - high heat, add chopped onions and cook until they have softened. About 1 minute.
    8. Stir in the sauce. Let it simmer and reduce for 5 minutes or until thick and glossy.
    9. Add back in fried chicken and mix. Optional, garnish with green onions. Remove off heat and serve to enjoy!
