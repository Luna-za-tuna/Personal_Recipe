    1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
    2. Roll out the dough, cutting them into 8 equal sized squares. Grease the muffin tin, then press the dough into each muffin cup, pressing it up the sides.
    3. Start with a layer of cheese at the bottom (to prevent sogginess), then a sprinkle of pepperoni, a dollop of sauce, then a little more cheese and pepperoni. Then finish it off with a dollop more of sauce another sprinkle of cheese on top.
    4. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Mix together garlic butter and spread it over the top of the pizzas and any exposed crusts. Continue baking for another 5-8 minutes or until they are golden brown.
    5. Top the pizzas with parmesan immediately after they come out of the oven along with red pepper flakes (if desired).
