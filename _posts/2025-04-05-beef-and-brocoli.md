  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Thinly slice beef. Combine with water, shaoxing wine, kosher salt and baking soda. 
    2. Mix then add cornstarch and oil. Marinate for 5-10 mins so everything can absorb.
    3. Heat up a generous amount of oil and deep fry/ pan fry/ cook your beef. Do this in batches so the pan doesnâ€™t over crowd. 
    4. Remove beef from heat and set aside.
    5. Prepare your broccoli into florets. Cook in boiling water for 1 minutes. Drain and set aside.
    6. In a wok or pan (I like to use the same pan I used go cook my beef but remove most of the oil), heat up some oil and cook minced ginger and garlic for til fragrant.
    7. Once fragrant, add all of the ingredients listed under SAUCE. Cook this until it thickens. 
    8. When it thickens, add your broccoli and beef, combine well, turn off heat, top with sesame seeds and serve with rice.
