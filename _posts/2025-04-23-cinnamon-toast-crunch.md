  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Preheat oven to 350F.
    2. Mix flours, sugar, and baking soda together.
    3. Add oil and water and mix together into shaggy dough.
    4. Add in cinnamon and mix lightly so its not fully incorporated. This will help give it the signature waves of cinnamon.
    5. Take a section of dough and roll it flat (using parchment paper will help it not stick to the roller or surface).
    6. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
    7. Cut into small squares. A pizza cutter can help.
    8. Bake for 8-10 minutes, then reduce temp to 250F and bake for another 30 minutes
