    1. Preheat your oven to 420°F (215°C).
    2. Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps them crisp up in the oven.
    3. In a large bowl, add the chicken wings along with white vinegar, smoked paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, white pepper, black pepper, celery salt, salt, baking powder, cornstarch and beef tallow.
    4. Mix the wings thoroughly to coat them evenly with the seasoning mixture. Optional: Let the wings marinate in the fridge for 1 hour.
    5. Place the seasoned wings on a wire rack set over a baking tray to allow air circulation around them. Sprinkle a bit more salt all over the wings at this step if desired.
    6. Bake the wings in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes on each side. If needed, flip the wings over once more and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes or until the wings are crispy and golden.
    7. Garnish the wings with a squeeze of fresh lime juice, chopped green onion, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.
