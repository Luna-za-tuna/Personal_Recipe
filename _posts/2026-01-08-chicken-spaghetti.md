    1. Cook spaghetti following the directions on the box.
    2. Cut chicken breasts in half lengthwise to make them thinner. Season the chicken lightly with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
    3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add some olive oil. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until both sides are golden brown and the chicken reaches an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees F.
    4. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the skillet. Shred the chicken or cut it up into cubes and set aside.
    5. In the skillet, add 3 tbsp of butter. Add 3 tbsp of flour and stir. Let the flour and butter cook for at least minute. 
    6. Pour 2 cups of chicken broth into the skillet. Add 1 tbsp of minced garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, parsley, and paprika. Stir everything together well.
    7. Once this mixture starts to thicken, add 1 can of rotel (not drained), about 2 cups of shredded Colby Jack cheese and 1/4 cup of sour cream. Stir.
    8. Add the drained spaghetti noodles and the cut up chicken. Stir everything together well. Top with dried parsley.
