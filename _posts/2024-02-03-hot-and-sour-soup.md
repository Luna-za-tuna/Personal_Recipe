    * 1 tsp oil (any neutral oil)
    * 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (more or less to your preference)
    * 3 tbsp cornstarch (mixed with 5 TBSP/ 75 mL of water for slurry)

  directions_markdown: |-
    1. In a medium pot over medium heat, add 1 teaspoon of oil. 
    2. Once the oil is hot, add the crushed pepper flakes and stir fry for about 10 to 15 seconds.
    3. Immediately add the chicken stock, followed by the vinegar, both soy sauces, sugar, chicken bouillon powder, salt, and white pepper. Bring the soup to a boil.
    4. Once the soup is boiling, add the tofu, and mushrooms. Bring the soup back to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium.
    5. While stirring the soup, slowly stir in the cornstarch slurry until all has been added. Let the soup simmer until thickened, about 30 seconds.
    6. When the soup has thickened, slowly drizzle in the beaten eggs around the pot in a circular motion. Stir up the soup and add the sesame oil and sliced green onions.
    7. Top the soup with more green onions if you'd like and enjoy! The soup will be super hot, so you may want to wait a moment before serving.
  notes_markdown: |-
    * For thin egg drops: Stir the soup while pouring in the eggs or wait for a second or two between stirring the soup. The sooner and more you stir the soup, the thinner and wispier the egg drops will be. This may give your soup a cloudier appearance.
    * For thick egg drops: Let the soup sit for a few seconds before stirring. The longer you wait, the thicker ribbon the egg drops will be.
