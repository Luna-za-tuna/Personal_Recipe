    1. Slice pork belly into 2" pieces and place in a pot of cold water. 
    2. Bring to just before a boil to remove any impurities from the pork. Drain and remove any excess moisture from the pork with a paper towel.
    3. In a wok or heavy bottom pan (dutch oven works great), heat 2 tbsp neutral oil over medium high heat. 
    4. Add pork and cook for 2-3 minutes until the pork has a golden brown color.
    5. Add sliced ginger, bay leaves, star anise and rock sugar to the pork and cook for 1 minute to let the spices infuse.
    6. To your pork and spices, add 2.5 cups of water along with Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce. 
    7. Stir to combine and bring to a low boil and cover over low heat.
    8. Stirring occasionally to ensure sauce does not burn, simmer for 1 hour or until sauce has become thick and caramel-like and pork is tender.
    9. Serve immediately over hot rice and spoon over extra sauce.
