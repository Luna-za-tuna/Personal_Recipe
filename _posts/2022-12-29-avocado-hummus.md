    1. Drain the water from 1 can of chickpeas. You can choose to remove the skin from the chickpeas in order to make the hummus more smooth. Or you can leave them and the taste will be just as delicious, but the texture more chunky.
    2. To a food processor, add the chickpeas, avocado, cilantro, garlic, juice of 1 lime, and oil. Blend the ingredients for several minutes, until you have a creamy consistency and all of the ingredients are well combined.
    3. Taste the avocado hummus and add salt and pepper (as much as you like according to your taste).
