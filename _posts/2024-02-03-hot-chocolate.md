    1. Combine the milk, sugar, vanilla seeds (pod included), and salt in a medium saucepan. 
    2. Place over medium heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved and the milk is steaming but not boiling.
    3. Place the chopped chocolate into a heatproof bowl, and ladle in about a cup or so of the steaming milk into the bowl of chopped chocolate. 
    4. Let this sit for about a minute before gently stirring to melt completely. Stir another ladle of milk into the bowl to make it easier to combine the chocolate mixture with the remaining milk.
    5. Reduce the heat to low and gently whisk in the melted chocolate. Stir until the chocolate is incorporated and the mixture is homogenous. 
    6. Remove and discard the vanilla bean pod.
    7. Carefully ladle the vanilla hot chocolate into 4 mugs. Garnish with whipped cream, and marshmallows or dust the tops with cocoa powder and enjoy!
