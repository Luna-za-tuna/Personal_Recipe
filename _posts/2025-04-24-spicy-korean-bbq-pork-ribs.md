    2. In a food processor or blender, blend your apples and onion until it becomes a puree. 
    3. Add gochujang, gochugaru, soy sauce, rice syrup, brown sugar, sesame oil, grated ginger, minced garlic and cooking wine.
    4. Once your ribs have been soaking in water, rinse and drain under cold water. Pat dry.
    5. Pour your marinade (from step 2) all over your ribs. 
    6. Marinate in the fridge over night. (Note: marinate with the rib side up)
    7. Preheat oven to 375F
    8. The next day when you are ready to cook, place ur ribs on an oven safe baking dish— with the ribs facing up— cover your baking dish with foil and bake for 2 hours.
    9. After 2 hours, remove ribs from oven and flip it over so the meat side of the ribs is now face up. Brush honey all over the top of your ribs and broil for 5-10 minutes.
    10. Serve with rice and desired side dishes.
