  directions_markdown: |-
    1. In a large pot, heat your olive oil and butter. 
    2. Add in your onion, celery, carrot, pinch of salt, black pepper, Italian seasoning, and red pepper. Saute for about 5-7 minutes or until tender and beginning to caramelize.⁣ 
    3. Add in your Italian sausage and cook until no longer pink.
    4. Clear a center in your pot. Add in your tomato paste and let it cook off in the pan for about a minute before incorporating with the rest. Then cook for another 2 minutes.
    5. Sprinkle in your flour and stir. Cook for 1-2 minutes to cook out the raw taste.
    6. Deglaze with white wine, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Let that cook for about 2 minutes.
    7. Pour in your crushed tomatoes and chicken broth. Season with salt and pepper. Stir.
    8. Drop in your parmesan rind and bay leaf. Stir and simmer, uncovered, for 20-30 minutes. 
    9. Once finished, remove your parmesan rind (if you can find it) and bay leaf. 
    10. Pour in your tortellini and spinach. Simmer for another 3-4 minutes, until your tortellini is tender.
    11. Pour in your cream and parmesan. Stir until creamy. Serve immediately and enjoy!
