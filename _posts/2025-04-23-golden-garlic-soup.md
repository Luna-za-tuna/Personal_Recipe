    1. In a large pot, add olive oil and butter and let melt over medium heat. 
    2. Add chopped onion and caramelize slightly for about 5 minutes. Or longer if you have time.
    3. Add the chopped potato and sliced garlic. Season with salt, pepper, and turmeric.
    4. Stir and let sautée for about 5 minutes. Deglaze with white wine and add your stock + water.
    5. Bring to a bubble, add in a bay leaf, then reduce to low and let simmer (partially covered) for about 20 minutes.
    6. Cube up your bread, hit with olive oil and salt and toast in the oven at 400 degrees for about 10 min (or until golden).
    7. Ladle soup into oven-safe bowls, top with croutons, grated cheese and under the broiler for a few minutes until cheese is melted and it’s a bit golden on top. Garnish with herbs.
