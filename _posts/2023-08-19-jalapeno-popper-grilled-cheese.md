    1. Cook bacon on medium-low until crispy. 
    2. Add room temperature cream cheese to a bowl along with cheddar, bacon, cayenne, and garlic powder. Mix and salt & pepper to taste. Donâ€™t need too much salt because of the bacon.
    3. Destem and cut your jalapenos in half length-wise. Take out the guts and seeds with a spoon. Cook on medium heat to get colour for 5 minutes. Put another heavy bottom pan on top of the jalapenos while cooking. This will flatten the jalapenos and partially steam them so they get softer. They are finished when a little soft but still have some texture.
    4. Take your bread, spread some of the cheese mixtures, place a few jalapenos on, and spread the other piece of bread with cheese and top. Butter the outside of the bread and cook like grilled cheese on low heat. Done when crispy outside and melty inside. ENJOY.
