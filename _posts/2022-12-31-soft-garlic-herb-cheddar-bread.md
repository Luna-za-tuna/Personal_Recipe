    1. 1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the milk, yeast, and honey. 
    2. Let sit 5-10 minutes, until bubbly on top. 
    3. Add the eggs, 3 1/2 cups flour, and salt. 
    4. Using the dough hook, mix until the flour is completely incorporated, about 4-5 minutes. If the dough is still sticky, add the additional 1/2 cup flour, adding more as needed until the dough is smooth to touch.
    5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
    6. In a bowl, combine the cheeses, herbs, and garlic.
    7. Punch the dough down and roll out onto a lightly floured surface, creating a large rectangle about 12 x 18 inches. Sprinkle the cheese mix evenly over the dough. Starting with the long edge closest to you, roll the dough into a log, keeping it tight as you go. When you reach the edge, pinch along the edge to seal. 
    8. Using a sharp knife, cut the log of dough in half lengthwise, leaving a small portion at one end intact. Turn the halves out to expose the filling. Cross the dough ropes over each other, repeating the twisting until you have a long, twisted dough.
    9. Coil the dough into a circle. Carefully transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let sit 15 minutes.
    10. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Bake the bread for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Slice and serve warm.
